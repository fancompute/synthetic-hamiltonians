## Overview

This repository contains supporting simulations for the paper "Programmable photonic system for quantum simulation in arbitrary topologies". In this work, we describe a programmable photonic de- vice capable of emulating the dynamics of a broad class of Hamiltonians in lattices with arbitrary topologies and dimensions. We derive a correspondence between the physics of the device and the Hamiltonians of interest, and we simulate the physics of the device to observe a wide variety of phys- ical phenomena, including chiral states in a Hall ladder, effective gauge potentials, and oscillations in high-dimensional lattices. Our proposed device opens new possibilities for studying topological and many-body physics in near-term experimental platforms.
